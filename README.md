# Rusted Cart Pole

Testing how easy it is to make environment for reinforcement learning in Rust and use it in different languages.

Currently an implemention of cart pole mostly copied from [OpenAi Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py). Graphics included. Works also in browser with webassembly.
